# Introduction to the JAMstack

This is a repository I created to accompany my viewing of [Intrduction to the JAMStack](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/jamstack/). It contains several projects:
* sections/basic: a basic website, which accesses the GitHub-API to show the repsitories, which are owned by a certain user
* sectons/contact: a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) based website, which sends mails â€“ unfortunately there were some problems with `netlify dev`; therefore the website is unfinished
